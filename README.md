# Bookstore Chatbot
A chatbot to ask questions about products in an online bookstore.
https://huggingface.co/spaces/amgadhasan/bookstore-chatbot

## Architecture
The solution uses the following components:
1. LLM: This is the main component of the solution. It interacts with the user and has access to tools to get needed data to answer the question
2. Bookstore database: This is a SQL database created from the scraped data. It contains all the information about the books like price, quantity, category etc. It can be utilized using read-only SQL queries. 
3. Tools: We have one tool that allows the LLM to query the books database.
4. Chat interface: This is a web UI that exposes a chat interface with the LLM.

When the user asks the chatbot a question, the LLM is instructed to help the user with their queries. It can use tools to get relevant data from a SQL database to help guide its answers. The LLM is intructed to provide refernces to its answers by listing the sql queries used to get the data. This is helpful as the user can use the sql queries to check whether the LLM fetched the correct data.

## Challengs
### Unstructured SQL Output
The first version required the LLM to write the sql directly ina normal assistant response. This caused many issues with parsing the response as the LLM can sometimes add an introductory line like "Sure, here is the sql".

##### Solution
Create a tool that takes the sql query. This makes parsing the output much easier.

### Empty SQL Response
Some of the questions required writing sql queries that return no rows (e.g. there are no books that are out of stock). This would cause the LLM to hallucinate and keep querying the database again with a malformed sql query

##### Solution
Instruct the LLM that some sql queries return empty responses as there are no entries for the given query. Additionally, the tool definition is modified to mention that it "Returns `None` if no there are no entries for the provided query"

## Setup
This section explains how to setup and run the project
### 1. Clone the project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AmgadHasan/store-data-chatbot.git
cd store-data-chatbot
```

### 2. Setup environment variables

You need to setup the following environment variables in a `.env` file
```
# .env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key here>
CHAT_MODEL=gemma2-9b-it
```

### 3. Installing the project
#### UV

1. Make sure you have installed [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Install dependencies
```sh
uv sync
```

3. Scrape the data
```sh
uv run python src/scrape.py
```

4. Start the gradio app
Start the gradio app by running:
```sh
uv run python -m src.app
```
This runs the app on localhost

### Docker

1. Install Docker Engine
Make sure you have installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

[Optional] Use the run script
The `run.sh` file combines steps 2-4 into one script. You can run it as follows:
```sh
sudo bash run.sh
```

2. Build the docker image
```sh
docker build . -t bookstore-chatbot:latest
```

3. Scrape the data
The following code runs the container to scrape the data. We mount the local `data` folder to save the output data in a persistent manner:
```sh
docker run --user root -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data bookstore-chatbot:latest uv run python src/scrape.py
```

4. Start the gradio app
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env bookstore-chatbot:latest
```
